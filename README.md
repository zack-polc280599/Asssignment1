# Asssignment1
Assignment1 for Ada College. Due 15th Oct

For this assignment we were tasked to produce a game made in processing, a visual take on
java mainly designed to get a more visual representation of what we program. It allows to
understand what our inputs to the compiler actually do, and gets us into a smooth transition
between no coding experience to being able to write a functional game that meets criteria.
What we had to do:

● Create multiple flow charts / designs to get a better understanding
of how our games would function. It didn't have to be spot on
accurate in comparison to our final result, but should be remotely
close to where the flowchart is still valid after comparing it to the
final product.

● Code our own game. The game is a click and score game,
however the challenge is brought upon by moving circles that need
to be clicked to score points, giving 10 each up to a maximum of
100 where the game ends. If the player is recognised to have
clicked the background instead, they lose 1 life, from a starting
point of 5, and ending at 0
